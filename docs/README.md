# project-create-a-comprehensive

## Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive, user-friendly government citizen services portal.  The application streamlines citizen interaction with government services by providing a single platform for permit and license applications, tax filing and payment, public records access, service request submission, budget transparency, public information, and feedback mechanisms.  The platform prioritizes accessibility through multilingual support and intuitive design.

## Features

**Citizen Services:**

* **Permit & License Applications:**  Submit, track, and manage applications for various permits and licenses online.
* **Tax Filing & Payment:**  File taxes and make secure online payments.
* **Public Records Search & Access:**  Search and access public records, adhering to relevant privacy regulations.
* **Service Request Submission & Tracking:**  Submit service requests (e.g., pothole repair, street cleaning) and track their progress.
* **Transparent Budget & Spending Dashboards:**  View detailed information on government budgets and spending.
* **Meeting Schedules & Public Notices:** Access upcoming meeting schedules and public announcements.
* **Citizen Feedback System:**  Submit feedback and track the status of responses from government agencies.
* **Document Upload with Digital Signatures:**  Upload necessary documents with secure digital signatures.

**Technical Highlights:**

* **Multilingual Support:**  Supports multiple languages for enhanced accessibility.
* **Robust API:**  Well-documented and easily integrable API for future expansion and third-party integrations.
* **Secure Authentication & Authorization:**  Implements secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data.
* **Scalable Architecture:**  Designed for scalability to handle a large number of concurrent users.


## Technology Stack

* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11+), SQLAlchemy ORM
* **Frontend:** React with TypeScript
* **Database:** SQLite (for development; PostgreSQL recommended for production)
* **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose


## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Node.js 18 or higher
* npm or yarn
* Docker (optional, but recommended for production deployment)
* Git


## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Backend setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the application:**  Run the backend and frontend concurrently in separate terminal windows.

   * **Backend (from `backend` directory):**
     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```

   * **Frontend (from `frontend` directory):**
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

### Docker Setup

1.  Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2.  Run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build and start both the frontend and backend containers.

## API Documentation

Once the application is running, access the interactive API documentation at:

* **API Documentation:** http://localhost:8000/docs
* **Alternative API Docs:** http://localhost:8000/redoc


## Usage

**(Example -  Permit Application Endpoint)**

This section will be expanded with detailed examples upon completion of the API.  For now, refer to the interactive API documentation linked above.  A typical workflow might involve:

1.  User accesses the frontend.
2.  User selects a permit type and fills out the application form.
3.  The frontend sends a POST request to the `/permits` endpoint (or similar).
4.  The backend processes the request, validates the data, and stores it in the database.
5.  The backend returns a response indicating success or failure.
6.  The frontend updates the user interface to reflect the status of the application.
