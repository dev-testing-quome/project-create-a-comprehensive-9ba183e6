# Developer Setup Guide - project-create-a-comprehensive

This guide provides a comprehensive setup for developers working on the "project-create-a-comprehensive" government citizen services portal.  We'll cover both Docker (recommended) and native development setups.

## Prerequisites

**Required Software Versions:**

* **Python:** 3.9 or higher (for backend)
* **Node.js:** 16 or higher (for frontend)
* **Docker:** 20.10.0 or higher (for Docker setup)
* **Docker Compose:** 1.29.0 or higher (for Docker setup)
* **PostgreSQL:** 13 or higher (database)


**Development Tools:**

* Git
* Text editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, IntelliJ IDEA recommended)
* A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)
* Postman or similar API testing tool


**IDE Recommendations and Configurations:**

* **VS Code:** Install extensions for Python, JavaScript, and Docker. Configure linters (e.g., Pylint, ESLint) and formatters (e.g., Black, Prettier) based on project settings.
* **PyCharm/IntelliJ IDEA:**  Configure Python and JavaScript support.  Set up the integrated terminal for easy command execution.  Install relevant plugins for database management (e.g., DataGrip).


## Local Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

**1. Clone Repository:**

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd project-create-a-comprehensive
```

**2. Docker Setup Commands:**

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.

**3. Development docker-compose Configuration:**

The project should include a `docker-compose.yml` file defining the services (backend, frontend, database). A sample might look like this:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@db:5432/mydb
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - backend
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRES_DB=mydb
```

**4. Hot Reload Setup:**

The `docker-compose.yml` file (or separate configuration) should handle hot reloading for both frontend and backend.  This may involve using tools like `nodemon` (frontend) and automatic reloading within the Python development server (e.g., using `uvicorn` with appropriate reload settings).


### Option 2: Native Development

**1. Backend Setup (Python virtual environment, dependencies):**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Frontend Setup (Node.js, npm packages):**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

**3. Database Setup (local database configuration):**

Install PostgreSQL locally. Create the database using the `psql` command-line tool. Configure the database connection details in your backend settings (likely in a configuration file or environment variables).


## Environment Configuration

**1. Required Environment Variables:**

The application will require numerous environment variables for database connection, API keys, secret keys, etc.  A `.env` file is recommended.  Example:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
STRIPE_API_KEY=your_stripe_api_key
# ... more environment variables
```

**2. Local Development .env file setup:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with the necessary development environment variables.

**3. Configuration for different environments:**

Use a configuration management system (e.g., environment variables, a configuration file) to manage different settings for development, testing, staging, and production environments.


## Running the Application

**1. Start commands for development:**

* **Docker:** `docker-compose up -d --build`
* **Native:**  Start the backend server (e.g., `uvicorn main:app --reload`) and the frontend development server (e.g., `npm start`).

**2. How to access frontend and backend:**

* Frontend: Access the application through your web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your configuration).
* Backend: Access the backend API using tools like Postman or curl at `http://localhost:8000/api/` (or the port specified in your configuration).

**3. API documentation access:**

The project should include API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI).  The documentation endpoint will be specified in the project's documentation.


## Development Workflow

**1. Git workflow and branching strategy:**

Use a Git branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow) to manage code changes.  Create feature branches for new features and bug fixes.

**2. Code formatting and linting setup:**

Use linters (e.g., Pylint for Python, ESLint for JavaScript) and formatters (e.g., Black for Python, Prettier for JavaScript) to ensure consistent code style.  Integrate these tools into your IDE or use them via command-line tools.

**3. Testing procedures:**

Write unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend code.  Use a testing framework (e.g., pytest for Python, Jest for JavaScript).

**4. Debugging setup:**

Use your IDE's debugging tools or command-line debuggers to identify and fix bugs.


## Database Management

**1. Running migrations:**

Use a database migration tool (e.g., Alembic for SQLAlchemy) to manage database schema changes.

**2. Seeding development data:**

Create scripts to seed the database with sample data for development and testing.

**3. Database reset procedures:**

Define procedures for resetting the database to a clean state, useful for testing and development.


## Testing

**1. Running unit tests:**

Run unit tests using the chosen testing framework (e.g., `pytest` or `unittest` for Python, `Jest` for JavaScript).

**2. Running integration tests:**

Run integration tests to verify the interactions between different components of the system.

**3. Test coverage reports:**

Generate test coverage reports to assess the completeness of your testing efforts.


## Common Development Tasks

**1. Adding new API endpoints:**

Follow the project's API design guidelines.  Write the backend code, update the API documentation, and add corresponding frontend integration.

**2. Adding new frontend components:**

Develop new components using the project's frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).  Ensure proper integration with the backend API.

**3. Database schema changes:**

Use database migrations to manage schema changes.  Update the database schema, run migrations, and update any affected code.

**4. Adding dependencies:**

Use the project's package manager (e.g., `pip` for Python, `npm` for JavaScript) to add new dependencies. Update the project's dependency files accordingly.


## Troubleshooting

**1. Common setup issues:**

Consult the project's documentation or search online for solutions to common setup problems.

**2. Port conflicts resolution:**

Check for port conflicts and adjust ports in the configuration files if necessary.

**3. Dependency issues:**

Use the package manager's tools to resolve dependency conflicts.  Ensure compatibility between different libraries.

**4. Environment variable problems:**

Verify that environment variables are set correctly and accessible to the application.


## Contributing

**1. Code style guidelines:**

Follow the project's code style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb style guide for JavaScript).

**2. Pull request process:**

Create pull requests to propose changes.  Ensure that code is reviewed and tested before merging.

**3. Issue reporting:**

Use the project's issue tracker to report bugs and suggest improvements.


This guide provides a starting point.  Refer to the project's specific documentation for more detailed instructions and configurations. Remember to replace placeholders like `<repository_url>` with the actual values.
