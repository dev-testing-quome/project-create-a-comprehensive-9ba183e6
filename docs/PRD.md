## Product Requirements Document: Citizen Services Portal

**1. Title:** Project: Comprehensive Citizen Services Portal (CCSP)

**2. Overview:**

The Comprehensive Citizen Services Portal (CCSP) is a web application designed to consolidate various government services for citizens into a single, user-friendly platform.  This will improve citizen engagement, streamline government processes, and enhance transparency and accountability. The portal will offer a range of services, including permit and license applications, tax filing and payment, public records access, service request submission, budget transparency, public notices, and a feedback mechanism.  The application will leverage FastAPI for its backend and React for its frontend, ensuring scalability, performance, and a modern user experience.

**3. Functional Requirements:**

* **Core Features:**
    * **Permit & License Applications:**  Online application submission, status tracking, document upload (with digital signature verification), payment integration.
    * **Tax Filing & Payment:**  Secure online tax filing, payment processing integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal), tax history access.
    * **Public Records Search & Access:**  Searchable database of public records, with appropriate access controls and redaction where necessary.
    * **Service Request Submission & Tracking:**  Submission of service requests (e.g., pothole repair, streetlight outage), status tracking, communication with relevant departments.
    * **Budget & Spending Dashboards:**  Transparent visualization of government budgets and spending, accessible to the public.
    * **Meeting Schedules & Public Notices:**  Calendar of upcoming meetings, public notices, and agendas.
    * **Multilingual Support:**  Support for multiple languages to ensure accessibility.
    * **Document Upload with Digital Signatures:**  Secure upload of documents with digital signature verification.
    * **Citizen Feedback System:**  Mechanism for citizens to submit feedback, with response tracking and management.
    * **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user authentication and role-based access control.

* **User Workflows:**  Detailed user stories and workflows will be documented in separate user story maps.  Examples include: applying for a building permit, filing taxes, submitting a service request, searching for public records.

* **Data Management Requirements:**  Secure storage and management of citizen data, adhering to all relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).  Data backup and recovery procedures must be in place.

* **Integration Requirements:**  Integration with existing government systems (e.g., tax databases, permit databases), payment gateways, digital signature verification services, and potentially mapping services (for service request location).


**4. Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **Performance:**  The application should load quickly and respond to user requests within 2 seconds.  Load testing will be conducted to ensure scalability.
* **Security:**  Robust security measures, including input validation, authentication, authorization, encryption, and regular security audits, are mandatory.  Compliance with relevant security standards and regulations is required.
* **Scalability:**  The application must be able to handle a large number of concurrent users and a growing volume of data.
* **Usability:**  The application should be intuitive and easy to use for all citizens, regardless of their technical skills.  Usability testing will be conducted throughout the development process.
* **Accessibility:**  The application must comply with WCAG guidelines for accessibility.


**5. Technical Requirements:**

* **Technology Stack:**
    * Backend: FastAPI (Python)
    * Frontend: React.js
    * Database: PostgreSQL (with consideration for scalability and data integrity)
    * Deployment:  AWS, Azure, or GCP (to be determined)
* **API Specifications:**  OpenAPI specification (Swagger) will be used to define the APIs.
* **Database Schema Considerations:**  A robust and normalized database schema will be designed to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.
* **Third-Party Integrations:**  Specific APIs and SDKs for payment gateways, digital signature verification, mapping services, and potentially other government systems will be integrated.


**6. Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Each feature will have specific acceptance criteria defined in user stories.**  These criteria will be testable and measurable.
* **Success Metrics & KPIs:**  Key performance indicators (KPIs) will include user registration, service request completion rates, citizen satisfaction scores (measured through surveys), and system uptime.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  UAT will be conducted with a representative sample of citizens to ensure the application meets their needs and expectations.


**7. Release Criteria:**

* **MVP Definition:**  The MVP will include permit/license application, tax filing (simplified), public records search (limited scope), and a basic feedback system.
* **Launch Readiness Checklist:**  A comprehensive checklist will be developed to ensure all aspects of the application are ready for launch.
* **Post-Launch Monitoring:**  Continuous monitoring of system performance, security, and user feedback will be conducted after launch.


**8. Assumptions and Dependencies:**

* **Technical Assumptions:**  Availability of necessary APIs from third-party providers.  Successful integration with existing government systems.
* **Business Assumptions:**  Sufficient budget and resources are available for development and maintenance.  Government stakeholders will provide necessary data and support.
* **External Dependencies:**  Third-party APIs, government data sources, payment gateways.


**9. Risks and Mitigation:**

* **Technical Risks:**  Integration challenges with existing systems, API downtime, security vulnerabilities.  **Mitigation:**  Thorough testing, robust security measures, contingency plans for API downtime.
* **Business Risks:**  Lack of user adoption, insufficient budget, delays in government approvals.  **Mitigation:**  Targeted marketing campaigns, proactive communication with stakeholders, contingency planning for budget constraints.


**10. Next Steps:**

* **Development Phases:**  Agile development methodology will be used, with iterative sprints and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).
* **Timeline Considerations:**  A detailed project timeline will be developed based on feature prioritization and resource availability.
* **Resource Requirements:**  A project team comprising developers, designers, testers, and project managers will be assembled.


**11. Conclusion:**

The CCSP will significantly improve citizen engagement with government services.  This PRD provides a comprehensive framework for the development of a modern, scalable, and user-friendly application.  Successful implementation will require close collaboration between development teams, government stakeholders, and citizens.  Continuous monitoring and iterative improvements will be crucial for long-term success.
